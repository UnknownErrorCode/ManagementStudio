# ManagementStudio

ManagementStudio is a server-client application tailored for seamless development and management of the vSRO (Silkroad Online) database. It comprises a server component that interfaces with the SQL database and a client component that communicates with the server via the vSRO API, ensuring secure and efficient database operations.

- **Automatic Updates:** The `ManagementLauncher` component ensures that the client remains up-to-date with the latest features and fixes.
- **Comprehensive Change Logging:** The server maintains detailed logs of all changes, facilitating easy tracking and auditing of database modifications.
